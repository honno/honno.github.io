Hello there, thanks for visiting my site!

About me? The above covers the basics, otherwise my bio is the typical "I like
to create cool things" spiel --- I'll let you decide if I succeed in that
regard :)

## My projects

* ### 2021
  * **asciiforever.net**
    : [Site](https://www.asciiforever.net/){: class='www'}

    : [Site](https://www.yygarchive.org/){: class='www'}
    : [Source](https://github.com/honno/yyg-sandbox-search){: class='gh'}
    
    A searchable archive of the YoYo Games Sandbox,
    a games portal which has since shutdown.
    I extracted the games and metadata from a site save (a WARC),
    preprocessed it,
    and hosted the procured games on the Internet Archive 
    (which this site interfaces with).

    In-development testing suite for random number generators, implementing the
    tests recommended by [NIST SP800-22](https://github.com/honno/rngtest/blob/master/SP800-22.pdf). 
    A user-friendly command-line interface provided allows users to load, run
    and report on their data in a step-by-step fashion.

    Modifies the [NIST Statistical Test Suite](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Random-Bit-Generation/Documentation-and-Software)
    so that its randomness tests can be accessed individually,
    and subsequently provides a Python interface to use them.

    subsequent modelling.

  * **Financial analysis stack**
    : [Source](https://github.com/Joshgallagher/financial-analysis-stack){: class='gh'}
    
    A project that demonstrates how various distributed data and parallel
    processing services could be used for financial analysis. Made in
    collaboration with my friend [Josh](https://www.joshuagallagher.io/).

    An example application is provided, which uses the daily close prices of a
    stock to generate a linear regression model. This model is then used to
    predict the price of a stock at a given future date.

  * **quine.gz**
    : [quine.gz](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/downloads/quine.gz){: class='file'}
    : [Source (CRC)](https://gist.github.com/honno/4e6e4790e14c43bf5d6fa822fb56b6ea){: class='gh'}
    : [Article](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/2019/07/22/how-to-make-compressed-file-quines.html){: class='blog'}

    A GZIP file that decompresses an exact copy of itself, ad infinitum. Involved
    the creation of an abstract Lempel-Ziv program that self-expands, which was
    carefully translated into a DEFLATE compressed data stream using the built-in
    fixed Huffman alphabet.

    Also required designing a multiprocessing Python script that can find a
    self-referential CRC32 value.

    I explain the whole process in an extensive blog article, which comes with
    numerous retro ASCII charts for some reason.

    Level design inspired by [Karoshi](https://www.karoshigame.com/) and
    [100% Logical](https://gamejolt.com/games/100-logical/1268). Designed an
    auto-dialogue system with dynamic speech bubbles to improve the flow of

    My strange website. Now even responsive on some modern devices! The development
    environment look design comes from a desire to present myself as a hip hacker
    type---I'm not quite sure to whom though.

    Also includes a blog with some bespoke JS for interactive behaviour in
    articles.
